When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  + When you'd like to collaborate with other people
  + When you work on multiple computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  + You might be working on things that you aren't ready to merge

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    + Fork: allows you to make a copy on GitHub of a repository on GitHub
    + Clone: allows you to make a copy of a repository
    + Branch: allows you to make changes separate from the master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    + You can work offline and still have the most current GitHub files
      without yet merging your changes in

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    + "In person" code review
      - Easier: immediate feedback
      - Harder: reviewer could be influenced by requestor and miss a problem

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    + When you don't want to break everybody else
    + Benefit of branch: compartmentalizes your work from others until it is complete
      and reviewed
    + Benefit of master: less complicated to make sure everything is in synch
